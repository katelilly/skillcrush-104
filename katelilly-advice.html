			<h3>Perseverance is key</h3>
			<p>Even if a lesson or the course takes you longer than you think it should, keep going! Also, reach out to classmates on Mightybell. Everyone else is learning too, and will kindly offer you advice or commiserate. I have a friend serve as my accountability buddy (accountabilibuddy) who I report to weekly about if I've met my goals for that week.</p>
			
			<h3>Work through the tough parts, and soon it will click and you'll be sailing.</h3>
			<p>It took a while sometimes for a coding principle to 'click' for me. As I've worked through the web developer blueprint I've had mini revelations about how I could use what I'd just learned. Or an idea for an app popped into my head and I was delighted to realize that I knew how to make it happen.</p>	
			
			<h3>Keep your cheat sheets on hand</h3>
			<p>I printed all of my Skillcrush check lists and cheat sheets at a copy center and slipped them into plastic sheet protectors of a three-ring binder. Now I have my handbook close by when I'm working on a lesson and need to reference something. I love flipping through the glossy pages to physically reference something instead of switching screen views between pdfs and my code editor. I love this old-school tactile method, but ultimately you should use what organization habits work well for you and with your learning style.</p>
			
			<h3>Habit is your friend</h3>
			<p>Since I have an irregular schedule, I've made a habit in my daily routine to do a little coding. Daily effort has gone a long way towards completing a big project. I schedule larger chunks of time to work on projects and the daily habit keeps me motivated and on track between longer sessions.</p>
			
			<h3>Motivate and reward yourself</h3>
			<p>Having a favorite snack or leisurely drink while coding made me all the more motivated to ignore distractions and put the time in on my challenges. You're allowed to make yourself comfortable so you can better enjoy learning new skills. Celebrate your hard work!</p>
			
			<h3>Remember that your learning in quantifiable</h3>
			<p>No matter your profession, tech skills are valuable. Now you'll have a measurable 'x' number of projects to your name that you can show off to prove your aptitude.</p>
			
			<h2>Remember, you can do this!</h2>
